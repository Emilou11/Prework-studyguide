# Prework Studyguide

## Description

- The aim of this project is to create an accessible page to contain important reminders of my topics of study.
It will enable me to refresh my memory on what I have studied at a glance.
This project means I have an organised system for keeping notes in one place rather than having to go back through the modules to extract information.
The project has taught me the building blocks of the web development process.
